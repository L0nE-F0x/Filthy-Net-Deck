# Filthy Net Deck — Data pipeline & updates

## How the app syncs (automatic — there is no Refresh button)

Since v0.8.2 the app has no manual Refresh button. It re-downloads the published feed by itself: on launch, when connectivity returns (`online` event), and on focus / an hourly timer whenever the loaded copy is more than 90 minutes old.

**Syncing does *not* scrape MTGGoldfish, Melee, Untapped, or tournaments from your PC.**

| Step | What happens |
|------|----------------|
| 1 | `GET https://filthy-net-deck.netlify.app/meta/latest.json` (fixed — the URL-override setting was removed in v0.8.3) |
| 2 | Parse that JSON (formats, 8×8 decks, tournaments, sources) |
| 3 | Diff vs last snapshot (meta movement) |
| 4 | Cache in memory + local snapshot for offline/diff |
| 5 | Check `version.json` for a newer **app** build (soft update banner) |

If the Netlify JSON cannot be fetched, the app shows the **last successfully downloaded copy** (real data, banner marks it offline). There is no built-in seed pack — with no network and no cached copy the app shows an explicit error state.

```

**Cutting-edge accuracy depends on how often the pipeline runs and how good its sources are.** The app only ever re-downloads whatever is already published on Netlify.

## What the **pipeline** does (server / CI)

File: `pipeline/build-meta.mjs`  
Modules: `pipeline/sources/{magic-gg,mtgo,melee,untapped,aggregate,common}.mjs`

| Source | What we pull | Accuracy |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **magic.gg/decklists** | Official WotC/Arena ranked + championship posts (HTML card runs) | **Authoritative** when parsed |
| **MTGO** (`mtgo.com/decklist/…`) | Embedded `window.MTGO.decklists.data` JSON (full main + SB) | **Authoritative** |
| **MTGGoldfish metagame** | Archetype names + meta % | Ranking signal |
| **MTGGoldfish deck export** | Full Arena/text 60s for mapped archetypes | **Authoritative** when not CF-blocked |
| **Melee.gg SearchResults** | Recent paper/RCQ/Arena event links (date-filtered) | Event intel |
| **Untapped.gg** | Arena ladder meta + archetype links | Ladder signal (lists often login-walled) |
| **Built-in pack** | Installer fallback only | Tagged `fallback` — never presented as live |

**Priority when assigning lists onto the 8×8 grid:**

`magic.gg` → `mtgo` → `mtggoldfish export` → `melee` (if lists) → keep tagged fallback

**Policy (product rule):**

1. Prefer **exported tournament / official decklists** over hand-written cards.
2. Never invent a 60 from memory when a source list exists.
3. Tag each deck with `listQuality`: `authoritative` | `partial` | `fallback`.
4. Surface quality + source URL in the app (Deck detail + Settings).

### MTGO details

Event pages are JS-rendered for the UI, but the full payload is already in the HTML:

```js
window.MTGO.decklists.data = { event_id, description, decklists: [ { player, main_deck: [...] } ] }
```

Each card has `qty`, `sideboard`, and `card_attributes.card_name`. We parse that JSON directly — no headless browser required.

Example: https://www.mtgo.com/decklist/standard-challenge-32-2026-07-0912847094

### magic.gg details

Index: https://magic.gg/decklists  
Articles (e.g. Traditional Standard Ranked) contain continuous `N Card Name` runs which we pack into 60/15 boards.

## Set radar (`sets.json`)

Arena-first upcoming expansions (spoilers + dates). **No Alchemy.**

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `npm run sets` | `pipeline/build-sets.mjs` → Scryfall `/sets` + spoiled cards |
| `pipeline/sources/set-calendar-overrides.json` | Optional official Arena / spoiler dates |
| `website/meta/sets.json` (+ `public/meta/`) | Published feed the app downloads |
| App page **Sets** | Countdown (Arena emphasized), spoiler rail, Scryfall link |

Daily CI runs `npm run sets` after the deck meta job. Arena dates are `official` when overridden, otherwise `estimated` (paper − 3 days) and labeled in the UI.

## Built-in app updater

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Signed (preferred)** | `plugin-updater` reads `updater/latest.json`, verifies minisign against the pubkey in `tauri.conf.json`, then **download + install + relaunch** in one click. |
| **Silent NSIS (desktop fallback)** | If signed metadata isn’t available but `version.json` has a newer build + `downloadUrl`, the app downloads the official setup to temp, runs ` /S`, and relaunches. **Never opens Chrome.** |
| **Browser (last resort)** | Vite preview / non-Tauri only: open the installer URL externally. |

`website/version.json` shape:

```json
{
  "version": "0.7.0",
  "downloadUrl": "https://filthy-net-deck.netlify.app/downloads/Filthy-Net-Deck-Setup-0.7.0.exe",
  "notes": "What changed…"
}
```

**End-to-end release is mandatory** for any user-visible change — see root `AGENTS.md`.

Ship steps when releasing a new app build:

1. Bump `package.json` / `src/version.ts` / `src-tauri` version.
2. `npm run tauri:build` with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (+ password) → copy installer + `.sig` into `website/downloads/`.
3. Update `website/updater/latest.json` (version, notes, url, **signature**).
4. Update `website/version.json` + `public/version.json`.
5. Update `website/index.html` download links + marketed copy.
6. **Share card:** update `og:*` / `twitter:*` / page title+description; edit `website/assets/_gen_og.py` (version + features); run `python website/assets/_gen_og.py`; set image URLs to `og-image.png?v=<version>` so caches refresh.
7. Push `main` (Netlify). Confirm live `version.json` / `updater/latest.json` / OG image.
8. Tag `vX.Y.Z` for macOS CI when shipping a mac build.

Full checklist: root `AGENTS.md`.

## How to keep meta accurate

1. Run `npm run meta` (export + `--live`) on a schedule (GitHub Action daily).
2. Commit or artifact-upload `website/meta/latest.json` to Netlify.
3. Users’ apps auto-sync → get that JSON.

Ideal end state: pipeline only ships decks whose `mainboard` came from magic.gg, MTGO JSON, Goldfish export, or Melee decklist text, validated against Scryfall legality where possible.
